   <h1> Real madrid </h1>
  <h2>The best team of all time </h2>
  <p>Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (33) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 19 times, as well as nine Spanish Super Cups and two Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cups (1985 and 1986).

Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign the talented Argentinian striker Alfredo Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain.

From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

<p>The president of Real Madrid in the 2000s, Florentino Pérez, was responsible for some of the biggest transfers was in international football. His idea of forming the best team possible was to buy big names and not so much thinking of balancing the team. Then Florentino Pérez was the president the club brought together a team of superstars, famously called the Galácticos. The Galácticos era of Real Madrid included players such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, David Beckham, Christiano Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos.

Four times is the world record concerning transfer fees broken between 2000 and 2012 … In 2000 is Luís Figo bough from Barcelona for €62 million; in 2001 is Zinedine Zidane bough from Juventus for €77.5 million; in 2009 is Cristiano Ronaldo is bough from Manchester United for €94 million; in 2009 is Gareth Bale bough from Tottenham for €100 million.

  Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol], meaning Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid.

Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history.

Real Madrid is one of the most widely supported teams internationally. The club was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football team. In 2021, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.

Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.

In domestic football, the club has won 68 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga. In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies; a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record seven club world championships.

Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 11 December 2000 with 42.35% of the vote, and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004. The club was also named Best European Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on 11 May 2010. In June 2017, Madrid succeeded in becoming the first club to win consecutive titles in the Champions League era. In May 2022, they won a record-extending fourteenth European Cup, making it five titles in the last nine seasons. As of December 2022, Real Madrid are ranked sixth behind Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA club rankings.

<p>Here are some of the facts about each player that played in real madrid </p>

   <p>Cristiano Ronaldo (born February 5, 1985, Funchal, Madeira, Portugal) Portuguese football forward who was one of the greatest players of his generation.

Early life and career
Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan, who was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as Sporting Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first team in 2002.</p>


<p>A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.

Club play
After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of Europe’s biggest football clubs, Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest season with United came in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May 2008, Ronaldo captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours for his stellar 2007–08 season. He also led United to an appearance in the 2009 Champions League final, which they lost to FC Barcelona.

Soon thereafter Ronaldo was sold to Spain’s Real Madrid—a club with which he had long been rumoured to want to play—for a then record £80 million (about $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La Liga history during the 2010–11 season (his record was broken the following season by his rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona). In 2011–12 Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the League season. He scored a total of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award (the FIFA World Player of the Year was renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010). In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a Champions League title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d’Or award. In 2014–15 he netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October 2015 to become the club’s all-time leading goal scorer. He scored 35 La Liga goals in 2015–16 and helped Real win its record 11th Champions League title, and in December 2016 he won a fourth career Ballon d’Or for his accomplishments. Ronaldo scored 42 goals for Real across all competitions in 2016–17 and led his team to La Liga and Champions League titles that season, which resulted in a fifth career Ballon d’Or award. In 2017–18 he scored 44 goals in 44 games, and Real won a third straight Champions League title.

In July 2018 he reached a four-year contract worth €112 million (about $132 million) with the Italian powerhouse Juventus. He finished his Real career with 311 goals in 292 matches. He scored 28 goals in his first season with Juventus—his lowest domestic goal total since his last season with Manchester United—as the powerhouse club won its eighth straight Italian league title. In the 2019–20 season Ronaldo helped the club capture another league title, and Juventus later won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana and the 2021 Coppa Italia Final. Several months after the latter match, he left Juventus and returned to Manchester United. His second stint with the club proved disappointing, however. Both Ronaldo and Manchester struggled, and he expressed growing dissatisfaction with the club. In November 2022 his contract was terminated by “mutual agreement.” The following month Ronaldo signed with the Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr.</p>

  <p>Kaká, (born April 22, 1982, Brasília, Brazil), Brazilian football (soccer) player who was named the World Player of the Year by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) in 2007.

Kaká owed his nickname to his younger brother Rodrigo, who as a child could not pronounce Ricardo and could manage only “Caca.” Kaká was seven when the family moved to São Paulo. A keen football enthusiast, he was taken on by the São Paulo FC the following year. At age 15 he was given a contract, but his progress was interrupted three years later by a serious spinal injury (sustained in a swimming accident), which threatened his career. He recovered, however, and made his first-team debut in January 2001. That year he scored 12 goals in 27 matches as an attacking midfield player. In 2002 he debuted on the Brazilian national team, playing in a match against Bolivia, and later that year Brazil won the World Cup.</p>
  
 <p>Kaká’s growing exposure on the world stage prompted interest from leading European clubs, and in August 2003 AC Milan signed him for $8.5 million. He made his first appearance in Italy the next month in a 2–0 win over Ancona. Kaká was equally adept at initiating and finishing attacks, and his forceful all-around skills developed with Milan. Kaká finished eighth and seventh, respectively, in balloting for FIFA Player of the Year in 2005 and 2006 before winning almost every available honour in 2007, when he was named both European Player of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year. In addition, Milan won the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League title in 2007.

After signing an extension with Milan in early 2008, Kaká became the highest-paid footballer in the world, with an annual income from the game alone amounting to €8 million (about $12 million) and extensive corporate sponsorship deals. Although he professed a desire to finish his career in Milan, Kaká transferred to Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid in June 2009, a move that was spurred by the Italian club’s dire financial straits. He was a key figure on the Real squads that won the 2011 Copa del Rey (Spanish cup) and the 2011–12 La Liga (Spanish top division) title. In 2013 Kaká returned to AC Milan. The following year Kaká and Milan mutually agreed to terminate his contract, and he signed to play with the expansion team Orlando City SC of North America’s Major League Soccer (MLS), which began play in 2015. (He was loaned to São Paolo for the 2014–15 season.) Unlike other notable stars who played in the MLS toward the end of their careers, Kaká kept up his strong play in the U.S., earning All-Star honours in each of his first two seasons with Orlando City. He retired from professional football in December 2017.

In international play Kaká was a key contributor to Brazil’s runs to the quarterfinals at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups, but he failed to make the national side when his home country hosted the 2014 Cup.</p>

  <p>Zinedine Zidane, (born June 23, 1972, Marseille, France), French football (soccer) player who led his country to victories in the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship. He later found success as a manager.

After playing for the junior team US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined Cannes in 1989 and quickly became the focal point of the team’s offense. A rangy midfielder, he had exceptional upper body strength and footwork skills that were complemented by his superior field vision. In 1992 he was transferred to Bordeaux, where he scored a career-high 10 goals in his first season with the team. Two years later Zidane was named Best Young Footballer in France and made his debut in international competition with two goals in 17 minutes against the Czech Republic.</p>
  
<p>In 1995 Zidane helped secure a place in the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cup final for his Bordeaux club. The following summer, however, he was transferred to the Juventus club in Italy, where he soon became as much of a favourite as he had been in France. In 1997 Zidane appeared on Juventus’s winning team at the World Club championship and UEFA Super Cup as well as on its Italian league-winning squad. Juventus also reached the Champions League final in 1997 and 1998. Zidane joined Real Madrid in 2001, and the following year the team won the Champions League title and the European Super Cup. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) named Zidane World Player of the Year three times (1998, 2000, and 2003).

Zidane was also a success in international competition. He had an eventful 1998 World Cup, which was held in France for the first time. Zidane stomped on an opponent in the second game of the first round and was suspended for two contests. There was speculation that he would be kicked off the team, but he returned in the quarterfinal round. Zidane scored two goals in the final against Brazil, and France took the World Cup with a 3–0 victory. In 2000 Zidane was named player of the tournament after leading France to the European Championship.

Although it had failed to score a goal in its World Cup title defense in 2002, France entered the 2006 World Cup as one of the favourites. Zidane’s outstanding performance in the tournament propelled the team into the final against Italy. Toward the end of second-half penalty time, with the score tied at one—Zidane having scored France’s lone goal—he head-butted an Italian player who had been taunting him, which led to a red card and ejection for Zidane. Without their captain, France lost to Italy on penalty kicks. Despite his ignoble exit in the final, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player. He retired from professional football after the 2006 World Cup.

In 2013 Zidane became an assistant manager at Real Madrid, and the following year he took over managerial duties at Real Madrid Castilla, the top-division club’s reserve team. In January 2016 he was promoted to manager of Real when the club made a mid-season coaching change. Zidane led Real to the La Liga title in the 2016–17 season. In addition, he guided the club to victory in the 2015–16 Champions League tournament, an accomplishment the team repeated in 2016–17 and 2017–18. He shockingly resigned from his managerial position just days after the 2018 Champions League final, citing his belief that the club needed a cultural change. His time away from the sidelines was brief, however, as he returned to manage Real in March 2019 soon after the club had been eliminated from the Champions League tournament. The following year Real won another La Liga title.</p>
